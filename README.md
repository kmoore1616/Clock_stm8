A simple but capable alarm clock based on the STM8S003F3 MCU. The system interfaces with buttons, a speaker, 
and an LCD via a shift register to accomplish its goal. The purpose of this project was to deepen my understanding of the STM8/ST7 
environment by programming the entire system in STM8 assembly, giving me intimate control over the processor and memory while 
reinforcing core embedded software fundamentals.
